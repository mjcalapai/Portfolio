                                Snowboarding is an activity I picked up in the past few years and have fallen in love with quickly.
                                 I enjoy pushing myself to try new trails and sometimes tricks on the mountain, and occasionally I love 
                                 to sit back and just enjoy the view of all the mountains and valleys covered in snow.

                                Exercising is freeing to me. I try to exercise for at least an hour every day. I believe exercise helps 
                                everyone both mentally and physically, and it is essential to me being productive each day. Any type of 
                                exercising gets it done for me. Whether it is the gym, zip-lining, rock climbing, playing sports, cliff diving,
                                riding a bike, running, or anything else that gets me moving, I am probably very enthusiastic about it if

                                My love for technology has been around for as long as I can remember. It was passed down from me by my 
                                family. One of my Grandfather's owned one of the first personal computers. The other worked in IT and 
                                has stayed up to date in modern technology up to the day I am writing this. My parents loved science fiction.
                                We used to have family nights watching star trek together. The first one we watched was the Voyager series.
                                Seeing all of that technology would give me a lot of hope to see what people came out with in my future. This
                                curiosity was bolstered by the advances apple made seemingly every year as I grew up. During the summers of 
                                my elementary and middle school years, I would go to stem camp where I got to mess around with computers.
                                I got to build websites, games, and use the adobe suite for my creative needs. I always loved going to that 
                                camp and after that, I kept up with Photoshop and Adobe After Effects through high school. Leaving high 
                                school, I noticed my best subject had been Math, and remembered my excitement going to camp and writing code,
                                so I enrolled in college majoring computer science. I have not looked back since. I love the unique fact
                                that while writing software, you can break some certain things but you are on a virtual machine and can just
                                use command-z. This allows for an unmatched level of creative freedom, which is something I am really grateful
                                for and I look forward to using this freedom more in the future while I learn more about my future field!
